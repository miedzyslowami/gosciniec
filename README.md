**[Project preview](https://miedzyslowami.github.io/gosciniec/)**

## **Description:**  

This is a copy of original page http://kerbud.pl/malinowy-gosciniec/ made by me for training purposes. 

HTML, JS, CSS were written by me from scrach so the page looks like the original, the mechanism and structure are different though. 

### **1.RWD**
Page works fine on each size-screen.

### **2.SLIDER**
Infinity slider works better than in original :).

### **3.HAMBURGER menu**
Hamburger works better than original :). I made a nice hamburger transition.

1.Write in a terminal ```git clone https://github.com/miedzyslowami/gosciniec.git``` to clone repository
2.Write in a terminal ```npm install``` to install all deps

## **Usage:**
1.Write in a terminal ```gulp watch```- to run and watch changes in all scss files
